Please run npm install for getting Node_Modules folder.
Userdetails is the Client Registration form which is the main form for collecting data.
I have also checked by pushing the data to the test database for few fields and so you could see the axios calls related to this form.
You will have the data collected in the form of JSON object and can be seen in Console window.
